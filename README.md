# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Titanic Dataset

## Overview
This project performs EDA on the Titanic dataset to understand patterns and relationships in the data.

## Key Findings
1. **Survival Rate**: Only about 38% of passengers survived.
2. **Class Impact**: 1st class passengers had significantly higher survival rates (63%) compared to 3rd class (24%).
3. **Gender Difference**: Females had much higher survival rates (74%) than males (19%).
4. **Age Distribution**: Most passengers were between 20-40 years old. Children had higher survival rates.
5. **Fare Correlation**: Higher fares correlated with higher survival rates, likely due to class association.

## Visualizations
- Histograms showing distributions of numerical features
- Boxplots identifying outliers
- Correlation matrix showing relationships between variables
- Interactive plots showing survival patterns
